# Superhero OOP Project

This Python project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using a **Superhero** theme. It includes:

- Class creation with attributes and methods  
- Constructor (`__init__`) usage  
- Inheritance (`Speedster` subclass inherits from `Superhero`)  
- Encapsulation (private attributes)  
- Polymorphism (method overriding)

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run the script:

```bash
python superhero.py
